# 42LIBFT-PROJECT : 🧰 libft
YOUR VERY FIRST OWN LIBRARY ---- >> This project is your first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.
# ABOUT LIBFT-PROJECT :
Programming in C can be very tedious when you don't have access to the very useful standard functions.
This project gives you the opportunity to rewrite those functions to understand them and learn to use them.
The library will help you for your future projects in C. Through this project, you have the opportunity
to extend your list of functions in your own way! For more detailed information, look at the subject of this project.

⚠️ NOTE ⚠️ : To be successful with moulinette on this project I had to put all the files in the same directory. I have just put them in folders and modified the Makefile to have a better organized repository.
